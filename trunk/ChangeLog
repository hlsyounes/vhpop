	* Fixed bug that made end times equal start times when scheduling
	steps with temporal orderings.

	* Effects with a false link condition must not be removed during
	instantiation.  It is necessary to keep them so that interference
	between concurrent actions can be properly detected.  This fixes a
	bug that was introduced in the most recent code overhaul.

2002-12-16  Håkan L. S. Younes  <lorens@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Fixed memory leaks of actions effects, and formulas.

	* All lists are now stored directly in objects, instead of being
	stored indirectly as pointers to lists.

	* Types are no longer required to be declared before they are used
	as supertypes.

	* Instead of stripping static preconditions before planning phase,
	just do not add static open conditions.  This prevents unnecessary
	duplication of objects.

2002-09-23  Håkan L. S. Younes  <lorens@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Removed known memory leaks in handling of variable bindings.

	* Compute projections lazily for ActionDomain objects.

2002-09-21  Håkan L. S. Younes  <lorens@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Fixed compatibility problems with GCC 3.x.

2002-09-20  Håkan L. S. Younes  <lorens@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Terms and formulas are no longer instantiated when planning with
	lifted action.  This reduces memory usage.  It also means that
	there is a unique instance of every variable, which simplifies
	variable comparison.  All variables are now compared using pointer
	comparison instead of string comparison, and this leads to a
	significant performance improvement when planning with lifted
	actions.  Variables are paired with step ids when stored in
	binding constraints so that variables from the same operator but
	different instantiations can be separated.

	* Fixed test for durative actions in ipc3-vhpop script.

2002-07-22  Håkan L. S. Younes  <lorens@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Changed string comparisons to pointer comparisons for simple
	types, names, and literal predicates.  This both improves speed
	and reduces memory usage.
