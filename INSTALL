Installation from the git sources require autoconf and automake. If you
are running on a ubuntu/mint variant, make sure these are installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install autoconf automake autoconf-archive libtool
```

Then, run the following commands:

```bash
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
```

the 'configure' script accepts some options, run './configure --help' to
see them.


For brief information on how to run VHPOP, use the following command:

  ./vhpop --help

If you are unable to build VHPOP, please report your problems to
